# Congruity Application Atlas

This repository is a practical atlas for applying the **Law of Congruity** to real-world systems.

While other repositories formalize the theory, biology, and structural foundations of Congruity, this atlas answers a different question:

> **How is Congruity actually used?**

Here, Congruity is treated as:
- a diagnostic instrument,
- an admissibility filter,
- and a proportionality constraint across scales.

---

## What This Repository Is

- A **map of applications**, not a textbook.
- A bridge between theory and execution.
- A reference for researchers, engineers, clinicians, and decision-makers.

Each section documents:
- the domain,
- the dominant form of incongruity,
- how Congruity reframes the problem,
- and what improves when proportionality is restored.

---

## What This Repository Is Not

- Not a predictive oracle.
- Not a black-box optimization method.
- Not a replacement for domain expertise.

Congruity works **upstream** of tools, models, and policies.

## Application Domains Covered

1. Biology & Medicine  
2. Cognition & Artificial Intelligence  
3. Energy, Physics & Infrastructure  
4. Markets & Systemic Risk  
5. Disasters, Early Warning & Resilience  

Additional domains may be added as the framework expands.

---

## Status

This atlas is **active and growing**.  
Each application is grounded in already formalized Congruity principles.
